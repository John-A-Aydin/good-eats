## Good eats

Good eats is a recipe sharing website built with S3, MongoDB, tRPC, and Next.js

You can check out the website [here](https://good-eats-tawny.vercel.app/)

## Why a recipe sharing website?

The original idea for this came from me wanting to make an svg based [pie chart react component](https://github.com/John-A-Aydin/good-eats/blob/main/src/components/pieChart.tsx).

Other than that, I just love cooking
